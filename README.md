# Inverter-Transistor-Oscillator.DSN:
An inverter circuit design using a transistor astable oscillator and a 12V battery source. The number or tansistors could be increased (connected in parallel) to increase current handling capacity or power rating of the inverter (with the transformer also chosen to handle expected power).
